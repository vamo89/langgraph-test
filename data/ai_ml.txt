Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming the way we interact with technology. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, helping to predict outcomes for unforeseen data.
2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without any guidance.
3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Deep Learning, a subset of ML, uses artificial neural networks to process data and make decisions. These networks are inspired by the human brain's structure and function.

Applications of AI and ML:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Healthcare Diagnostics
- Financial Forecasting

The future of AI and ML holds immense potential for solving complex problems and improving human lives across various domains.
